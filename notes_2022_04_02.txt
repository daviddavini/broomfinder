Highlights:
 -  Built the "Feature Extractor", to compute the relevant features 
    of a classroom+situation for the objective function

Earlier this week, I had made the "Feature Extractor", which really
just amounted to loading a CSV file into JS, and working with datetime 
data in JS.

Today, I deployed the project to github! I created a new react app in 
the subfolder my-app/ and pushed it to the gh-pages branch of my repo by
following this tutorial:
